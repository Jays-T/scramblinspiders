A Hackathon is a sprint-like event in which teams
collaborate intensively on software projects.

The goal of a hackathon is to create a functioning

Hackathons are a great way to get real-world
experience of agile programming and working
together in a team, just like you would in a dev role.

### **Hackathon Description** ###
You'll be assigned to a team, and work together to build a project based on an assigned theme.

All levels are welcome, from absolute beginners to advanced developers.
