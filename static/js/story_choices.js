                 ...on a Halloween late afternoon. It's Friday and your
                   work for today is finally done! <br /> You can now go home, and you have 
                   been looking forward to it. A Halloween brings that special

                   you with satisfaction and put a smile on your face.<br /> Children will be 
                   wearing costumes and going trick or treating. You don't have to 
                   worry about your kids' costumes, as you already took care of that 
                   the day before - today is a perfect day. You can go to a pub near 
                   your house to celebrate being free from obligations (no matter 
                   how brief it is), before you go home.<br />

                You get out of your car near your local pub so you can walk home,

                that the fog has gotten thicker on your way from work. You look

                home!" - you say at the entrance, before taking your coat off. You 
                greet and chit-chat with your friends while progressing towards 
                the bar. What a perfect evening for a Halloween.
                Your friends convince you to have another drink before you go 
                home, and drinks just keep coming... You forget about time as 
                hours pass and your busy day has made you feel sleepy. You nod 
                off but quickly snap out of it to realise everyone is gone...
